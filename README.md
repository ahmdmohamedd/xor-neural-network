# XOR Neural Network using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a simple feedforward neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to solve the XOR problem. The XOR problem is a classic example in artificial intelligence, where the model is trained to predict the output of the XOR logic gate given two binary inputs.

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of a feedforward neural network for solving the XOR problem using the TensorFlow library. The XOR function returns `1` when the inputs are different and `0` when they are the same.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python installed on your system along with the required libraries.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmdmohamedd/xor-neural-network.git
   cd xor-neural-network
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the neural network code:
   ```bash
   python xor_nn.py
   ```

2. After training, the model will print predictions for the XOR inputs:
   ```plaintext
   Input: [0 0] => Predicted Output: [0], Expected Output: [0]
   Input: [0 1] => Predicted Output: [1], Expected Output: [1]
   Input: [1 0] => Predicted Output: [1], Expected Output: [1]
   Input: [1 1] => Predicted Output: [0], Expected Output: [0]
   ```

## Model Details

The neural network is a simple feedforward model built using the following architecture:
- **Input Layer**: 2 neurons (for the 2 input features of XOR).
- **Hidden Layer**: 2 neurons with ReLU activation function.
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron with sigmoid activation for binary classification.

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.

## Results

After training, the neural network is able to successfully predict the XOR logic for the following inputs:
- **Input [0, 0]**: Output 0
- **Input [0, 1]**: Output 1
- **Input [1, 0]**: Output 1
- **Input [1, 1]**: Output 0
